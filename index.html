    <h3>HTML and The Internet</h3>
 </div>
 <div class="text">
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. These documents are all stored on servers. When viewing a webpage your computer requests an HTTP from the server and then opens the appropriate file and displays the file through your web browser. 

    <p>All HTML documents are divided in to multiple "invisible boxes" of content.  These boxes can contain things such as images, text and even links to other pages.  When creating an idea for a website, it can be useful to take something as simple as a pencil to draw out the overall design of the website.  You can then take it one step further by drawing boxes around related content.  This will help give you an idea as to how the website would be built.  There are many ways to make these "invisible boxes".  One way it to use what is called a "div" tag.  You simply place a opening "div" tag at the begining of the content and a closing "div" tag at the end.</p>

  <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Tags and elements make up every page of HTML code. This is how computers read the documents.  Tags consist of two parts.  There is an opening tag and a closing tag.  To create the opening tag you use the less than sign, put your command inside, and place a greater than symbol on the other side.  You then place your content inside and close the tag by using the less than sign, backslash, your command, and the greater than sign.   Everything from the begining less than symbol to the ending greater than symbol make up an element.  </p>

      <h3> Computers are Stupid </h3>
</div>
    <div class=text>
      <p>Computers are stupid in that they can't catch basic coding mistakes that a human can catch. They simply do what they are told to do by the coding within the HTML document. Therefore, having a period out of place or forgetting to close a tag can cause major problems.  This is why you must be so precise with all coding.</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3></div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Elements of an HTML document are either Inline or Block.  Block elements are used to create "invisible boxes" around the content inside of them.    Inline elements generally only apply to the content in between the opening and closing of the tag.</p>

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Google Chrome is a unique internet browser.  Whenever you open a internet page using Chrome, a menu appears in the upper right hand corner.  You can click on this menu and go to "tools".  From there you can go to "developer tools".  When you open developer tools on a webpage, you can see all of the HTML coding for that page.  This is a great tool when you are first starting to code.  By looking at existing code and changing the code, you can start to figure out how things are programed.</p>

  <h3> Avoiding Repetition </h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Avoiding repetition in HTML coding is very important.  For instance, a programer that uses a lot of repetition will often write the exact same cases they will simply copy and paste code in to different parts of a document.  When that programer decides to make changes to a document, they have to go through every line of code ensure that small change was replicated.</p>
    <p>Consistency is another very good reason to avoid repetition when writing HTML code.  If you want to give a document or a series of documents the same feel, then they must be coded the same.  This is best done by assigning specific "classes" to each part of the document.  By having different "classes" for each part of the document, you only have to change the class file in your CSS to make changes throughout the entire document.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<div class="text">
    <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.  These style sheets are what is used to determing how a page looks on the internet.  When compared to a house lets day the CSS files would be the   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">This page</a> can be used as a resource for looking up different CSS.  It would be almost impossible to learn every CSS variable, so it is common to use a website like this.</p>

    <h3>Computer</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>In general, machines are designed to do a certain task.  Unless you take the machine apart and alter it, the machine will only do what it was designed for.  This is where computers are different from other machines.  A computer can be <em>programmed</em> to do almost anything we want.  If you are able to write a very specific sequence of instructions for a computer to follow, you can make a computer do whatever you tell it to do.</p>

    <h3> Computer Program </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>A computer program can best be described as a very precise sequence of steps that a computer can follow to complete a task.  The web browser you are looking at this document in is a program.  The software I am writing this code in is a program.  The list can go on and on.</p>

    <h3> Programming Language </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>A programming language is what computer programmers use to tell a computer what to do.  COBOL is an example of a programming language.  It was one of the first high-level programming languages ever made.  It was designed for the Harvard Mark I computer by Rear Admiral Grace Hopper and many of her former employees in 1959.</p>

    <h3> Python </h3>
  </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Pyhton is one of many computer programming languages.  Its name was derived from the T.V. series <em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>.  You can enter Python code in to a Python Interpreter and press "Run" to see the results.  The interpreter takes the code you wrote and converts it to instructions that the computer can read and execute or "Run".</p>

      <div class="topic" id="grammar">
        <h3> Grammar</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>Programming languages, just like human languages, have grammar rules they must follow.  These grammar rules tell us what is "correct" and what is "incorrect" for a particular language.  These grammar rules are necessary because computers are so stupid.  Humans can usually understand what someone is trying to say even if they don't use the correct structure.  Computers cannot!  Code must be written <em>exact</em> or it will not run in Python.</p>

      <h3> Creating a Structured Document with HTML </h3>
  </div>
   <div class="text">
    <p> HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
    The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
    In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... 
    </p>
     <p>    
    When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is. </p>
